# Sibyl -- Feature Requirements Document Order

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Project** | Sibyl |
| **Parent Document** | [PRD v0.4](./PRD.md) |
| **Created** | 2026-02-08 |
| **Revised** | 2026-02-27 |
| **Purpose** | Define the ordered sequence of FRDs for incremental implementation |

---

## Overview

Each FRD represents a single unit of full functionality that can be implemented, tested, and delivered independently. FRDs are ordered by dependency -- each assumes all prior FRDs are complete. A Setup Document (FRD 0) establishes the project foundation before any feature work begins.

### Ordering Principles

1. **Infrastructure before consumers** -- RAG before agents that query it; SSE before the dashboard that displays it.
2. **Data producers before data consumers** -- Claims Agent before PDF highlights; all specialist agents before the Judge; Judge before Source of Truth.
3. **Complexity deferred where possible** -- The Geography Agent (satellite API + vision model) is last among specialists; the Chatbot is last overall since it has no downstream dependents.

- Hybrid retrieval: semantic search (cosine similarity) + keyword search (PostgreSQL `ts_vector` full-text search) with re-ranking
- Ingestion of IFRS S1 and S2 standard texts into the corpus (`data/ifrs/s1_full.md`, `s2_full.md`, `s1_s2_mapping.json`)
- Ingestion of SASB industry standards (`data/sasb/`)
- RAG service API (`rag_service.py`, `rag_lookup.py` tool)

**Exit criteria:** IFRS/SASB corpus is embedded and retrievable; hybrid search returns relevant paragraphs for test queries.

---

### FRD 2: PDF Upload & Ingestion

### FRD 6: Legal Agent

**PRD Section:** 4.5

**Scope:**

**Scope:**

- Evidence evaluation across all specialist findings: sufficiency, consistency, quality, completeness
- Cyclic re-investigation: generating `ReinvestigationRequest` objects with refined queries, specific agent targets, evidence gap descriptions
- Iteration depth control (configurable max, default 3 cycles)
- Final verdict production: Verified, Unverified, Contradicted, Insufficient Evidence

- LangGraph node: `judge_evidence` (`judge_agent.py`)
- Model: Claude Opus 4.5

**Exit criteria:** The complete agent pipeline runs end-to-end. Claims are extracted, routed, investigated, judged (with re-investigation if needed), and final verdicts with IFRS mappings are produced and persisted.

---

### FRD 12: Detective Dashboard

**PRD Section:** 4.10, 7.2 (Analysis Page center panel)

**Note:** The implemented design diverges substantially from the original v1.0 spec. See `FRDs/FRD-12-detective-dashboard.md` v2.0 for the current authoritative specification. Key divergences are noted below.

**Scope (as implemented):**

- React Flow (`@xyflow/react`) graph with **warm cream avatar village** aesthetic -- no dark theme
- Custom `EggAvatarNode.tsx`: egg-shaped avatar characters (Menny, Bron, Columbo, Mike, Izzy, Newton, Rhea, Judy) with pulsating reasoning text below each avatar
- Custom `MessagePoolNode.tsx`: semi-transparent table at the center of the specialist pentagon showing recent InfoRequest/InfoResponse messages
- Custom `ClaimEdge.tsx`: straight edges for claim/infoRequest flows; custom quadratic bezier swoop-under for reinvestigation edges
- **Horizontal left-to-right layout**: Claims near Orchestrator (left), specialist pentagon (center), Judge (right)
- **Pentagon layout** for five specialist agents around the Message Pool table
- `AgentNavBar`: fixed bottom navigator bar with small avatar icons for all agents
- `AgentDetailSheet`: bottom sheet that slides up from beneath the AgentNavBar showing full reasoning history, findings, and agent-specific content
- `VillageBackground.tsx`: decorative SVG huts/trees/path at ~11% opacity
- Module-level SSE event cache and graph state cache (keyed by `reportId`) for cross-navigation state persistence
- Confetti (`canvas-confetti`) on `pipeline_completed` event
- Pulsating Investigation tab tooltip guiding users to the graph after upload

**Exit criteria:** Users watch the full investigation in real time through an animated avatar village with a bottom sheet for detailed agent inspection, confetti on completion, and full state persistence across navigation.

---

### FRD 13: Source of Truth Report

**PRD Section:** 4.11, 7.2 (Source of Truth Page)

**Scope:**

- Report compilation backend (`report_compiler.py`, `compile_report` LangGraph node)
- Report page organized by four IFRS pillars (Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, Metrics & Targets)
- Claim cards: original text with PDF link, IFRS paragraph tags, expandable evidence chain, full agent reasoning, Judge verdict, color-coded compliance status (green/yellow/red)
- S1/S2 cross-mapping sidebar (redesigned: intro text, visual flow arrows, expandable claim lists)
- Disclosure Gaps section: per-pillar listing of fully unaddressed (grey) and partially addressed (orange) IFRS requirements with materiality context
- Filter bar: pillar, claim type, verdict status, investigating agent, IFRS paragraph search, disclosure gap status
- Backend report endpoints (`report.py` routes)
- `IFRSParagraphTag.tsx` hover popovers with 44-entry frontend registry and prefix-match fallback

## Implemented Features Beyond Original FRD Scope

The following features were implemented after the initial FRD plan and are not covered by FRDs 0-14. They are documented here for completeness.

### Design System Overhaul (All Pages)

Implemented across all pages and components during FRD 12-13 work:

- Warm cream color palette (`#fff6e9`, `#4a3c2e`, `#6b5344`, `#8b7355`, `#eddfc8`, `#e0d4bf`)
- Prohibited: all `slate-*` Tailwind classes, `rounded-xl` on content cards, emoji
- Lucide React icons exclusively
- Framer Motion blur-fade-in entrance animations on all page content
- No padded background on close/back button hover (only text color changes)
- Consistent button styling: "Begin Analysis" style extended to all primary action buttons

### DocsPage (`/docs`)

A comprehensive documentation page added to the frontend routing:

- Hero section with product overview
- IFRS S1/S2 explainer
- Pipeline diagram (agent flow)
- Message Pool architecture section
- Verdict types reference
- Agent roster: alternating avatar/description layout (agent on left → description on right, then alternates) as the user scrolls
- Scroll-triggered blur-fade-in animations (Framer Motion `whileInView`)
- Accessible via `/docs` route and linked in the global navigation header (`Header.tsx`)
- No "Reference Documentation" eyebrow header (removed for cleaner presentation)

### Analysis List Page Redesign (`AnalysisListPage.tsx`)

- Large centered heading (`2.75rem`) near vertical center of viewport
- Subheading, both center-aligned
- No top/bottom dividers on the list container
- No dividers between list items
- Stagger fade-in animation for list items (`delay: i * 0.05s`, `duration: 0.22s`)
- Hover: filename underlines instead of container background darkening

### Upload Content Preview Redesign (`ContentPreview.tsx`)

- Removed redundant stat repetition (stats shown once only)
- Improved information hierarchy: document title, then metadata, then section list
- Page numbers changed from illegible grey (`text-slate-300`) to warm brown (`text-[#8b7355]`)
- Section icon changed from grey `BookOpen` to warm brown
- No stat grid duplication

### Global Header Updates (`Header.tsx`)

- Sibyl leaf logo (`sibylLogo.png`) added next to "Sibyl" wordmark in nav bar
- Logo sized to ~32px with negative margins to compensate for transparent padding
- DocsPage link added to navigation
- Browser tab favicon updated to `sibyl-favicon.png`

### AgentVillage Landing Page Fix (`AgentVillage.tsx`)

- Avatar float animation decoupled from hover: `useAnimationFrame` + `useMotionValue` for continuous float; `whileHover` for scale, composing independently
- Hover off no longer snaps avatar back to float start position
