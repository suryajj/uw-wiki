## Summary

FRD 0 establishes the complete project foundation for Sibyl. It produces a working monorepo with a Dockerized backend (FastAPI), frontend (React + Vite), PostgreSQL 17 with pgvector, and Redis -- all orchestrated by Docker Compose. The backend scaffold includes application configuration, database connectivity via SQLAlchemy 2.1, Alembic migrations, all five core database models, the shared LangGraph `SibylState` Pydantic schema, and an OpenRouter API client wrapper. The frontend scaffold includes a Vite + React + TypeScript project initialized with shadcn/ui, TailwindCSS v4, a dark-mode-first theme matching the detective aesthetic, a layout shell with sidebar and header, and client-side routing for all planned pages. No feature logic is implemented -- FRD 0 produces the skeleton that all subsequent FRDs build upon.

## Executive Summary (Gherkin-Style)

```gherkin
Feature: Project Setup and Infrastructure

  Background:
    Given  Docker and Docker Compose are installed on the host machine
    And    no prior Sibyl code exists

  Scenario: Start all services
    When   the developer runs `docker-compose up`
    Then   PostgreSQL 17 with pgvector starts and is accessible
    And    Redis starts and is accessible
    And    the FastAPI backend starts and binds to port 8000
    And    the React frontend starts and binds to port 5173
    And    all services are networked and can communicate

  Scenario: Backend health check
    Given  all services are running
    When   a GET request is sent to /api/v1/health
    Then   the backend responds with 200 OK and a JSON body containing service status

  Scenario: Frontend layout shell
    Given  all services are running
    When   a user navigates to http://localhost:5173
    Then   the browser renders the AppShell with a sidebar, header, and main content area
    And    the theme is dark mode by default
    And    navigation links for Home, Analysis, and Report pages are visible
    And    clicking a navigation link routes to the correct page shell (no feature content yet)

  Scenario: Database models and migrations
    Given  PostgreSQL is running
    When   Alembic migrations run (automatically on backend startup)
    Then   all five tables are created: reports, claims, findings, verdicts, embeddings
    And    the pgvector extension is enabled
    And    the embeddings table has a vector column

  Scenario: Environment configuration
    Given  a developer clones the repository
    When   they copy .env.example to .env and fill in the OpenRouter API key
    Then   all services can read their configuration from environment variables
    And    no secrets are hardcoded in source code
```

## 1. Docker Compose Infrastructure

### 1.1 Services

Docker Compose orchestrates four services on a shared network:

| Service | Image / Build | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `db` | `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` | 5432 | PostgreSQL 17 with pgvector extension pre-installed |
| `redis` | `redis:7-alpine` | 6379 | Task queue for background PDF pipeline processing |
| `backend` | Build from `backend/Dockerfile` | 8000 | FastAPI application server |
| `frontend` | Build from `frontend/Dockerfile` | 5173 | Vite dev server serving the React SPA |

### 1.2 Service Dependencies

```
frontend ──depends_on──► backend ──depends_on──► db
                                 ──depends_on──► redis
```

- `backend` waits for `db` and `redis` to be healthy before starting.
- `frontend` waits for `backend` to be healthy before starting.
- Health checks: `db` uses `pg_isready`, `redis` uses `redis-cli ping`, `backend` uses the `/api/v1/health` endpoint.

### 1.3 Volumes

| Volume | Mount | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `pgdata` | `/var/lib/postgresql/data` on `db` | Persist database data across container restarts |
| `./backend` | `/app` on `backend` | Live code reload during development |
| `./frontend` | `/app` on `frontend` | Live code reload with Vite HMR |

### 1.4 Network

All services join a single Docker bridge network (`sibyl-network`). Services reference each other by service name (e.g., the backend connects to PostgreSQL at `db:5432`).

### 1.5 PostgreSQL Configuration

The system shall:

1. Use the `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` image, which includes the pgvector extension pre-installed.
2. Create the default database `sibyl` on first run via the `POSTGRES_DB` environment variable.
3. Enable the pgvector extension via the initial Alembic migration (`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector`).
4. Set `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` from environment variables.

### 1.6 Redis Configuration

The system shall:

1. Use `redis:7-alpine` with no authentication for MVP (no password, no TLS).
2. Expose port 6379 within the Docker network.
3. Redis is used only as a task queue broker. No persistent data is stored in Redis.

---

## 2. Backend Scaffold

### 2.1 Dockerfile

The backend Dockerfile shall:

1. Use `python:3.12-slim` as the base image.
2. Install system dependencies required by `psycopg[binary]` and PyMuPDF.
3. Copy `requirements.txt` and install Python dependencies.
4. Copy the application code.
5. Expose port 8000.
6. Run the FastAPI application using `uvicorn` with `--reload` for development.

### 2.2 Application Shell

The FastAPI application entry point (`app/main.py`) shall:

1. Create the FastAPI application instance with title `"Sibyl API"`, version `"0.1.0"`, and a description.
2. Configure CORS middleware to allow the frontend origin (`http://localhost:5173`).
3. Include the API router with a `/api/v1` prefix.
4. Register a startup event that runs Alembic migrations programmatically (using `alembic upgrade head`).
5. Register a shutdown event that disposes of the database engine.

### 2.3 Configuration (`app/core/config.py`)

The system shall define a `Settings` class using Pydantic `BaseSettings` with the following fields:

| Setting | Type | Default | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `str` | `postgresql+psycopg://sibyl:sibyl@db:5432/sibyl` | `DATABASE_URL` env var |
| `REDIS_URL` | `str` | `redis://redis:6379/0` | `REDIS_URL` env var |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `str` | *(required, no default)* | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` env var |
| `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` | `str` | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` env var |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `list[str]` | `["http://localhost:5173"]` | `CORS_ORIGINS` env var |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` | `int` | `50` | `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` env var |
| `MAX_JUDGE_ITERATIONS` | `int` | `3` | `MAX_JUDGE_ITERATIONS` env var |

A singleton `settings` instance is created at module level and imported by other modules.

### 2.4 Database Engine (`app/core/database.py`)

The system shall:

1. Create an async SQLAlchemy engine using `create_async_engine` with the `DATABASE_URL`.
2. Create an `async_sessionmaker` for dependency injection.
3. Define a `Base` declarative base class for all ORM models.
4. Provide an async context manager / FastAPI dependency (`get_db`) that yields a database session and handles commit/rollback.

### 2.5 Dependencies (`app/core/dependencies.py`)

The system shall define shared FastAPI dependencies:

1. `get_db` -- yields an async SQLAlchemy session (from `database.py`).
2. `get_settings` -- returns the `Settings` singleton.

### 2.6 Utility Helpers (`app/core/utils.py`)

The system shall define a thin utility module providing common helpers used across the codebase:

```python
"""Thin utility helpers shared across the Sibyl backend."""

from uuid import UUID

import uuid_utils


def generate_uuid7() -> UUID:
    """Return a new UUID v7 (RFC 9562).

    Wraps ``uuid_utils.uuid7()`` so the rest of the codebase imports from a
    single location.  If the stdlib ever ships ``uuid.uuid7()`` in a future
    Python release, only this module needs to change.
    """
    return uuid_utils.uuid7()
```

All modules that need a UUID v7 shall import `generate_uuid7` from `app.core.utils` rather than calling `uuid_utils` directly.

### 2.7 API Router and Health Check

The system shall:

1. Define a root API router in `app/api/routes/__init__.py` that aggregates all route modules.
2. Implement a health check endpoint:

```
GET /api/v1/health

Response 200:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected",
  "redis": "connected",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

3. The health check shall verify database connectivity (execute a simple query) and Redis connectivity (execute a PING). If either fails, the corresponding field shows `"disconnected"` and the overall status shows `"degraded"`.

### 2.8 Route Module Stubs

The following route modules shall be created as empty stubs (routers with no endpoints) to establish the file structure for subsequent FRDs:

| Module | File | Future FRD |
|---|---|---|
| Upload | `app/api/routes/upload.py` | FRD 2 |
| Analysis | `app/api/routes/analysis.py` | FRD 5 |
| Stream | `app/api/routes/stream.py` | FRD 5 |
| Report | `app/api/routes/report.py` | FRD 13 |
| Chat | `app/api/routes/chat.py` | FRD 14 |

Each stub creates an `APIRouter` with the appropriate prefix and tags but registers no endpoints.

### 2.9 Requirements

The `requirements.txt` shall include the following core dependencies (pinned to major.minor versions):

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `fastapi` | Web framework |
| `uvicorn[standard]` | ASGI server |
| `pydantic` | Data validation (v2) |
| `pydantic-settings` | Environment-based settings |
| `sqlalchemy[asyncio]` | ORM with async support (2.1) |
| `psycopg[binary]` | PostgreSQL async driver |
| `alembic` | Database migrations |
| `pgvector` | pgvector SQLAlchemy integration |
| `redis` | Redis client |
| `httpx` | Async HTTP client (for OpenRouter) |
| `langgraph` | AI orchestration framework |
| `langchain-core` | LangChain core abstractions |
| `pymupdf4llm` | PDF parsing (for future FRDs) |
| `pystac-client` | Satellite data access (for future FRDs) |
| `uuid-utils` | UUID v7 generation (RFC 9562); wrapped in `app/core/utils.py` |

---

## 3. Database Models and Migrations

### 3.1 Model Overview

Five SQLAlchemy ORM models form the core data layer. All models inherit from `Base` and share common patterns:

- `id`: UUID v7 primary key, application-generated using `generate_uuid7()` from `app/core/utils.py` (wraps the `uuid-utils` package)
- `created_at`: Timestamp with timezone, server-default `now()`
- `updated_at`: Timestamp with timezone, server-default `now()`, updated on modification

**UUID v7 Strategy:**

All primary keys in Sibyl use UUID v7 (RFC 9562) for time-ordered, sortable identifiers. UUID v7 provides:
- 48-bit Unix timestamp prefix (millisecond precision) for chronological ordering
- Better PostgreSQL B-tree index performance due to sequential nature
- 74 random bits ensuring global uniqueness
- Generated via the `uuid-utils` package (`uuid_utils.uuid7()`), wrapped in a thin helper at `app/core/utils.py`

UUIDs are generated at the application level (not database level) because PostgreSQL does not yet have native UUID v7 support.

### 3.2 Report Model (`app/models/report.py`)

### 3.7 Initial Alembic Migration

The initial migration shall:

1. Enable the `vector` extension: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector`
2. Create all five tables with the columns, constraints, and indexes defined above
3. The migration must be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

**Note:** The `uuid-ossp` extension is NOT required because UUIDs are generated at the application level using `generate_uuid7()` (from `app/core/utils.py`), not via PostgreSQL's `gen_random_uuid()` function.

### 3.8 Alembic Configuration

The system shall:

1. Configure Alembic in `alembic.ini` with the database URL sourced from the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
2. Configure `alembic/env.py` to use the async engine and import all models so autogenerate works correctly.
3. Store migration files in `alembic/versions/`.

## 4. LangGraph State Schema

### 4.1 Overview

The `SibylState` Pydantic model is the single shared state object for the entire LangGraph pipeline. It is defined in `app/agents/state.py` and referenced by all agent nodes. FRD 0 defines the schema only -- agent node implementations are deferred to subsequent FRDs.

### 4.2 Supporting Types

    events: list[StreamEvent] = []
```

### 4.4 Graph Definition Stub (`app/agents/graph.py`)

The system shall create a stub LangGraph `StateGraph` definition that:

1. Imports `SibylState` as the state schema.
2. Defines placeholder node names (no implementations): `parse_document`, `extract_claims`, `orchestrate`, `investigate_geography`, `investigate_legal`, `investigate_news`, `investigate_academic`, `investigate_data`, `judge_evidence`, `compile_report`.
3. Does NOT compile or execute the graph -- subsequent FRDs implement nodes and edges.
4. Includes a comment block mapping each node name to its implementing FRD.

### 4.5 Agent Node Stubs

The following stub files shall be created under `app/agents/`, each containing only docstrings and function signatures (no implementation logic):

| File | Node Function | FRD |
|---|---|---|
| `claims_agent.py` | `extract_claims(state: SibylState) -> dict` | FRD 3 |
| `orchestrator_agent.py` | `orchestrate(state: SibylState) -> dict` | FRD 5 |
| `geography_agent.py` | `investigate_geography(state: SibylState) -> dict` | FRD 10 |
| `legal_agent.py` | `investigate_legal(state: SibylState) -> dict` | FRD 6 |
| `news_media_agent.py` | `investigate_news(state: SibylState) -> dict` | FRD 8 |
| `academic_agent.py` | `investigate_academic(state: SibylState) -> dict` | FRD 9 |
| `data_metrics_agent.py` | `investigate_data(state: SibylState) -> dict` | FRD 7 |
| `judge_agent.py` | `judge_evidence(state: SibylState) -> dict` | FRD 11 |

## 5. OpenRouter Client Wrapper

### 5.1 Purpose

The OpenRouter client (`app/services/openrouter_client.py`) provides a unified interface for all LLM calls in Sibyl. All agents use this single client to communicate with LLMs through the OpenRouter gateway.

### 5.2 Functional Requirements

The system shall:

1. Initialize an async HTTP client (`httpx.AsyncClient`) with the OpenRouter base URL and API key from settings.
2. Provide a `chat_completion` method accepting:
   - `model: str` -- the OpenRouter model identifier (e.g., `"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"`)
   - `messages: list[dict]` -- chat messages in OpenAI-compatible format
   - `temperature: float` -- defaults to `0.0`
   - `max_tokens: int | None` -- optional max output tokens
   - `response_format: dict | None` -- optional structured output format
3. Implement retry logic: 3 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) for transient failures (HTTP 429, 500, 502, 503, 504).
4. Return the response content as a string, or raise a descriptive exception on non-transient failure.
5. Include request headers: `Authorization: Bearer {api_key}`, `Content-Type: application/json`, `HTTP-Referer: https://sibyl.dev` (required by OpenRouter), `X-Title: Sibyl`.
6. Log all requests (model, token counts) and errors for debugging.

### 5.3 Model Constants

The system shall define model identifier constants:

```python
class Models:
    GEMINI_FLASH = "google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview"
    GEMINI_PRO = "google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview"
    CLAUDE_SONNET = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"
    CLAUDE_OPUS = "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"
    DEEPSEEK = "deepseek/deepseek-chat"
    EMBEDDING = "openai/text-embedding-3-small"
```

Note: Exact model identifiers should be verified against the OpenRouter API at implementation time.

---

## 6. Frontend Scaffold

### 6.1 Project Initialization

The system shall:

1. Initialize a Vite + React + TypeScript project in the `frontend/` directory.
2. Configure TypeScript with strict mode enabled.
3. Install and configure shadcn/ui (following the shadcn/ui CLI initialization for Vite).
4. Install TailwindCSS v4 using the CSS-first configuration approach (no `tailwind.config.ts` file; all configuration via CSS `@theme` directives).
5. Install React Router for client-side routing.
6. Install `@xyflow/react` (React Flow) as a dependency (used in FRD 12, but installed now to validate the dependency tree).
7. Install `@pdf-viewer/react` as a dependency (used in FRD 4, but installed now to validate the dependency tree).

### 6.2 Dockerfile

The frontend Dockerfile shall:

1. Use `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
2. Copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install`.
3. Copy the application source code.
4. Expose port 5173.
5. Run the Vite dev server with `--host 0.0.0.0` so it is accessible from outside the container.

### 6.3 Dark-Mode Theme

The system shall configure a dark-mode-first theme matching the detective/investigation aesthetic described in PRD 7.1:

| Design Token | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Background (primary) | Deep charcoal (`hsl(224, 20%, 10%)` or similar) | Main app background |
| Background (secondary) | Slightly lighter charcoal | Card/panel backgrounds |
| Foreground | High-contrast off-white | Primary text |
| Muted foreground | Medium grey | Secondary/metadata text |
| Border | Dark grey | Subtle borders and dividers |
| Accent (primary) | Slate blue | Primary interactive elements |
| Accent (destructive) | Crimson red | Error states, Judge agent |

**Agent color identity** (defined as CSS custom properties for consistent use across dashboard and report):

| Agent | CSS Variable | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Claims Agent | `--agent-claims` | Slate blue |
| Orchestrator | `--agent-orchestrator` | White/silver |
| Geography Agent | `--agent-geography` | Forest green |
| Legal Agent | `--agent-legal` | Deep purple |
| News/Media Agent | `--agent-news` | Amber/gold |
| Academic/Research Agent | `--agent-academic` | Teal |
| Data/Metrics Agent | `--agent-data` | Coral/orange |
| Judge Agent | `--agent-judge` | Crimson red |

### 6.4 Layout Shell

The layout shell consists of three components that wrap all page content:

**AppShell (`src/components/Layout/AppShell.tsx`)**

The root layout component. It shall:

1. Render the `Sidebar` on the left and `Header` at the top.
2. Render the active page content in a main content area that fills the remaining viewport.
3. Use a CSS Grid or Flexbox layout.
4. Apply the dark theme globally.

**Sidebar (`src/components/Layout/Sidebar.tsx`)**

The navigation sidebar. It shall:

1. Display the Sibyl project name/logo at the top.
2. Render navigation links for three pages:
   - **Home** (`/`) -- Upload landing page
   - **Analysis** (`/analysis`) -- 3-panel analysis view (detective dashboard)
   - **Report** (`/report`) -- Source of Truth report view
3. Highlight the currently active route.
4. Be collapsible (toggle between icon-only and full-width modes).

**Header (`src/components/Layout/Header.tsx`)**

The top header bar. It shall:

1. Display the current page title (derived from the active route).
2. Reserve space on the right for a future chatbot toggle button (FRD 14).

### 6.5 Client-Side Routing

The system shall configure React Router with the following routes:

| Path | Page Component | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `HomePage` | Upload landing page |
| `/analysis` | `AnalysisPage` | 3-panel analysis view |
| `/analysis/:reportId` | `AnalysisPage` | Analysis for a specific report |
| `/report` | `ReportPage` | Source of Truth report view |
| `/report/:reportId` | `ReportPage` | Report for a specific report |

Each page component is a stub that renders the page title and a placeholder message (e.g., "Upload page coming in FRD 2").

### 6.6 Page Stubs

The following page components shall be created in `src/pages/`:

| Component | File | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `HomePage` | `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` | Renders a centered placeholder with the text "Sibyl -- Upload a sustainability report to begin analysis" |
| `AnalysisPage` | `src/pages/AnalysisPage.tsx` | Renders a 3-panel layout placeholder (left, center, right panels with labels) |
| `ReportPage` | `src/pages/ReportPage.tsx` | Renders a full-width placeholder with the text "Source of Truth report will appear here" |

### 6.7 Component Directory Structure

The following component directories shall be created with empty `index.ts` barrel files (no component implementations):

- `src/components/Dashboard/`
- `src/components/PDFViewer/`
- `src/components/SourceOfTruth/`
- `src/components/Chatbot/`
- `src/components/Upload/`

### 6.8 Type Definitions

The following TypeScript type definition files shall be created in `src/types/` with the type definitions matching the backend schemas:

| File | Types |
|---|---|
| `claim.ts` | `Claim`, `ClaimType`, `ClaimVerdict`, `ClaimPriority` |
| `agent.ts` | `AgentName`, `AgentStatus`, `AgentFinding`, `InfoRequest`, `InfoResponse` |
| `ifrs.ts` | `IFRSPillar`, `IFRSParagraph`, `DisclosureGap`, `ComplianceStatus` |
| `report.ts` | `Report`, `ReportStatus`, `SourceOfTruthReport` |

These types mirror the backend Pydantic schemas and database models to maintain type safety across the stack.

### 6.9 API Client Stub

The system shall create `src/services/api.ts` with:

1. A base URL constant pointing to the backend API (`http://localhost:8000/api/v1`).
2. A configured `fetch` wrapper or axios instance with default headers.
3. A `healthCheck()` function that calls `GET /api/v1/health` and returns the response.
4. Stub functions (returning `TODO` comments) for future endpoints: `uploadReport()`, `getAnalysisStatus()`, `getReport()`, `sendChatMessage()`.

---

## 7. Environment Configuration

### 7.1 `.env.example`

The system shall provide a `.env.example` file at the project root with all required environment variables:

```env
# === Database ===
POSTGRES_USER=sibyl
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=sibyl
POSTGRES_DB=sibyl
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://sibyl:sibyl@db:5432/sibyl

# === Application ===
CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:5173"]
MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB=50
MAX_JUDGE_ITERATIONS=3
```

### 7.2 `.gitignore`

The `.gitignore` shall exclude:

- `.env` (but NOT `.env.example`)
- `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`
- `node_modules/`
- `dist/`, `build/`
- `.vite/`
- `pgdata/` (Docker volume data)
- IDE files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)

---

## 8. Exit Criteria

FRD 0 is complete when ALL of the following are satisfied:

| # | Criterion | Verification |

## Appendix C: SibylState Full Schema

See [Section 4](#4-langgraph-state-schema) for the complete field-by-field definition.

The state follows LangGraph conventions:
- All fields have defaults so the state can be initialized incrementally.
- Agent nodes return partial state updates (dicts) that are merged into the full state by LangGraph.
- The `events` list is append-only and streamed to the frontend via SSE.
- The `iteration_count` is incremented by the Judge Agent each cycle and checked against `max_iterations` by the conditional edge.

---

## Design Decisions Log

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` Docker image over manual extension install | Guarantees pgvector is available without custom Dockerfile; matches PRD spec for PostgreSQL 17 |
| Async SQLAlchemy (`create_async_engine`) over sync | FastAPI is async; async DB access prevents blocking the event loop during I/O-heavy agent operations |
| `psycopg[binary]` over `asyncpg` | psycopg3 (binary) is the recommended async driver for SQLAlchemy 2.x; supports both sync and async |
| Alembic migrations run on backend startup | Ensures database schema is always current in development; avoids manual migration steps for hackathon workflow |
| Single `SibylState` Pydantic model over multiple state objects | LangGraph requires a single state schema; all agent nodes operate on the same state; matches PRD Section 5.3 |
| HNSW index for vector search over IVFFlat | HNSW provides better recall at the scale of a hackathon project (hundreds of documents, not millions) |
| Frontend stubs render placeholder text | Validates routing and layout without implementing feature logic; subsequent FRDs replace placeholders |
| Agent color identity as CSS custom properties | Enables consistent agent theming across dashboard, report, and evidence panels; easy to reference in components |
| `httpx.AsyncClient` for OpenRouter over `requests` | Async-native; supports connection pooling; consistent with FastAPI's async architecture |
| TailwindCSS v4 CSS-first config over v3 JS config | PRD specifies TailwindCSS v4; v4 uses CSS `@theme` directives, eliminating `tailwind.config.ts` |
| All dependencies installed in FRD 0 (including future ones like PyMuPDF4LLM, pystac-client) | Validates the full dependency tree early; prevents incompatibility surprises in later FRDs |
| Route module stubs with empty routers | Establishes file structure and import patterns; subsequent FRDs add endpoints without restructuring |
| `Vector(1536)` dimension for embeddings | Matches `text-embedding-3-small` output dimensions (1536) as specified in PRD Section 5.5 |
| UUID v7 primary keys with application-generated `generate_uuid7()` | Time-ordered UUIDs (RFC 9562) provide better PostgreSQL B-tree index performance and chronological sortability while remaining globally unique; the `uuid-utils` package provides a compliant `uuid7()` implementation, wrapped in a thin helper at `app/core/utils.py` for a single import point; PostgreSQL does not yet support UUID v7 natively, requiring application-level generation |
| JSONB for flexible metadata columns | Allows agent-specific data structures (satellite image refs, source URLs, calculations) without schema changes |
